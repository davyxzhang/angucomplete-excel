# angucomplete-excel
An AngularJS directive based off of Daryl Rowland's angucomplete (https://github.com/darylrowland/angucomplete). It has been customized to work like the excel formulas.

Demo: [angucomplete-excel](davyxzhang.com/angucomplete-excel)

The demo uses angucomplete-excel for auto-complete and then takes the math operation to compute a new column out of the existing table data.
